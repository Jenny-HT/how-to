# How-To
These are the How-To articles I wrote. I am trying to keep them as simple as possible.
1. [How To - Update an Entry in the FetLife Translation](articles/update-entry-in-translation.md)
1. [How To - Review Changes on GitHub](articles/review-changes.md)

These are the How-To articles I bookmarked
1. [How To - Sync a Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) by GitHub
